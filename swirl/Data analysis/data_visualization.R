# Since dot plots effectively display the specific numerical value of one variable for each individual
# in the data set, they are particularly useful when analyzing smaller data sets

# A HISTOGRAM is similar to a dot plot, but instead of showing every specific value, it partitions the
# values of your data into several bins, providing a more condensed representation of the data.

# skewness is a measure of the extent to which the distribution of the data 'leans' to one side or the other

# a left skewed distribution = the majority of the distribution is located to the right of the mean

# in a left-skewed distribution, the value of the mean is less than that of the median

# in a symmetric distribution the mean and meadian are approximately equal in value
